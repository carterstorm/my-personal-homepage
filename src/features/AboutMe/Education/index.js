        <Paragraph>
            Regarding my experience and education, I graduated engineering studies at public university.
            I worked as an automatic line designer for almost 3 years, gaining valuable experience in machine
            design, creating engineering documentation, project management and working with clients. I started
            learning Frontend almost 1,5 years ago. My job as a constructor often involved business trips,
            overtime and weekend work, which made it difficult for me to continue my education. Whenever I could
            I took time to develop my skills. I didn't give up.

            After some time, to improve my systematic approach,
            I decided to sign up for an online programming school. The school offers an excellent community of
            students who support and learn from each other. I created a few simple applications on my own.
            At the same time during school, I decided to create the Nike website - fully responsive that closely
            resembled the orginal one. At the end of school, I received a project for a movie browser to code myself,
            which was created in Figma. During this project, I gained very valuable experience and self-confidence
            that I can handle similar projects ðŸ˜Š
