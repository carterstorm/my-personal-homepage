        <Paragraph>
            Regarding my experience and education, I graduated engineering studies at public university.
            I worked as an automatic line designer for almost 3 years, gaining valuable experience in machine
            design, creating engineering documentation, project management and working with clients. I started
            learning Frontend almost 1,5 years ago. My job as a constructor often involved business trips,
            overtime and weekend work, which made it difficult for me to continue my education. Whenever I could
            I took time to develop my skills. I didn't give up. However, over the course of my career, I have
            realized that my true passion was Frontend technologies. I decided to change the industry to develop
            in a field that gives me real pleasure and satisfaction.

            After some time, to improve my systematic approach,
            I decided to sign up for an online programming school,
            which was created by a friend of my friend ðŸ˜Š who has several years of experience as a Frontend Developer.
            I can confidently say that after joining this school, I have been learning Frontend technologies with
            enthusiasm and commitment for one year. The school offers an excellent community of students who support
            and learn from each other. Under the supervision of mentors, I created two simple applications
            - currency calculator and todo's list on my own. At the same time during school, I created a weather application
            and Nike homepage on my own. After a break due to my job, I decided to create the Nike website again.
            This time, I managed to create a more accurate, fully responsive website that closely resembled the
            original one. At the end of school, I received a project for a movie and actor browser to code myself,
            which was created in Figma. During this project, I gained very valuable experience and self-confidence
            that I can handle similar projects ðŸ˜Š
