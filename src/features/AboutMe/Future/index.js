        <Paragraph>
            I'm highly motivated to take action and expand my knowledge in the IT world.
            In the near future, I am starting my education at "Webamigos" programming school,
            where I will be participating in an upskilling program to enhance my knowledge.
            I will be learning best practices commonly used in Frontend teams to create better
            and cleaner code using React library and TypeScript. During the course, I will create
            a monorepo consisting of a frontend, backend and website that will communicate with
            each other and exchange data. I will be expanding my knowledge in topics such as: Vite,
            Storybook, Tailwind CSS, Nx, Next.js, Vitest, Jest, RTS, Node.js, NestJS and AI tools.
